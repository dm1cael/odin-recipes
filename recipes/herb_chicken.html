        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This grilled lemon herb chicken is juicy, flavorful, and perfect for a summer barbecue. The marinade of lemon, garlic, and herbs infuses the chicken with delicious taste and aroma.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>Zest and juice of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried rosemary</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs (such as parsley or basil), chopped for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>

            <li>Place chicken breasts in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken, turning to coat evenly. Cover (or seal the bag) and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably longer (up to overnight).</li>

            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and grill for 6-7 minutes per side, or until fully cooked through (internal temperature of 165°F or 74°C).</li>
            <li>Remove from grill and let rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped fresh herbs and serve hot.</li>
